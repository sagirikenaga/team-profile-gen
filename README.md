# Module 10 Challenge: Team Profile Generator

## Description

This project was built to design a library that stores the information of the employees involved in a specific project, including the manager, engineer(s) and intern(s). When ran through NODE.js, a series of questions appear that prompt the user to enter information regarding the project and the members. It allows for the main manager to be added, as well as any number of engineers or interns that are involved in the project. When completed, the inputted answers are displayed onto a properly formatted HTML file that creates a webpage containing the information of all employees under the project name. This project was built so that the user (i.e. a project manager) can easily keep track of all the employees involved in a specific project. This project allowed for me to apply my knowledge learned about NODE.js, the inquirer package and the jest package, to apply to earlier concepts throughout the course.

## Installation

Clone/fork this repository at https://github.com/sagirikenaga/team-profile-gen. Then run the commands: npm i & node index.js for the prompts to appear.

## Usage

This project is used by accessing the code through NODE, and answering the questions based on the series of prompts. After all the questions are completed, an index.html file is automatically produced, displaying all the inputted information in an organized manner.
